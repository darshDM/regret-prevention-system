# Regret Prevention System  

A **VS Code / Cursor IDE** extension that saves your precious code **before you inevitably ruin it**. It’s like a **"panic button"** for your ego, except you don’t even have to press it—because we know you’d forget to anyway.  

## Features  

- **Automatic backups** the second you open a folder—because manually saving is for people who trust themselves (lol).  
- **Configurable backup location**, so your backups don’t end up buried under that "Downloads" folder chaos you call a filing system.  
- **Enable/disable toggle**, for when you’re feeling brave (or just want to flex your Ctrl+Z skills).  
- **Excludes `node_modules` and `.git`**, because backing up 10GB of npm’s midlife crisis isn’t our idea of fun.  
- **Timestamped backups**, so you can relive the exact moment your genius turned into gibberish.  

## Configuration  

We’ve graced you with *options* because we’re generous like that. Tweak these in your settings (or leave them alone and let us do the thinking):  

* `regretPreventionSystem.backupPath` – Pick a spot for your backups that isn’t your desktop dumpster.  
* `regretPreventionSystem.enabled` – Flip it **on** (smart) or **off** (yolo)—your funeral, your choice.  

## Installation  

1. **Grab the .vsix file**—it’s that shiny thing I built for you. Download it, steal it, whatever. Just get it.  
2. Open **VS Code** or **Cursor IDE** (you know, that app you pretend to understand?).  
3. Head to the **Extensions** tab—like, where else would you install this?  
4. **Drag and drop the .vsix file** into the Extensions tab. Yes, drag it. Like it’s 1995 and you’re moving Clippy to the trash.  
5. Watch it install itself while you sip coffee and act like you coded this brilliance yourself.  

## How to Use  

1. Install this bad boy (see above, genius).  
2. Open **VS Code / Cursor IDE** settings—type "Regret Prevention System" if you’re too lazy to scroll.  
3. Set your **backup path** (or don’t, we’ll just shove it somewhere semi-logical).  
4. Open a folder. Any folder. We’ll ninja-save your code while you’re busy pretending you’ve got this under control.  
5. Break stuff. Cry. Restore from backup. Thank us later.  

## Notes  

- Backups are named like `folderName_timestamp`—because "project_2025-02-25_3am_oops" is way more poetic than "untitled1."  
- Each backup gets its own cozy little folder, so you won’t accidentally nuke your last lifeline. You’re welcome.  
- If your project’s a bloated mess, backups might take a hot second. Chill. It’s still faster than rewriting your entire career from scratch.  
- Yeah it is not in marketplace, I will upload after I complete my mess with manager

Built for the clumsy, the overconfident, and the “I’ll fix it later” crowd. Enjoy, you disaster-prone legend. 🚀
